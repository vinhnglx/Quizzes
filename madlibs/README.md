# MadLibs

- The practice is so simple, just fill to the blank. For example,

```
  I love ((noun)). I ((verb)) it every morning
```

This sentence can fill to

```
   I love books. I read it every morning
```

or

```
  I love coffee. I drink it every morning
```

- In addition, we can re-use the word

```
  Our favorite language is ((gem:a gemstone)). We think ((gem)) is better than ((a gemstone)).
```

Now, a `gem` is a variable.

```
  Our favorite language is Ruby. We think Ruby is betten than Emerald.
```
